What is polymorphism?," Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take multiple forms. In object-oriented programming, this refers to the capacity of objects to take on many different forms or avatars. This allows objects to respond differently to the same message, depending on the context in which it occurs. In C++, there are two types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism (function overloading) and run-time polymorphism (method overriding).

Question: What is runtime polymorphism in C++?
Answer: Runtime polymorphism, also known as dynamic polymorphism or late binding, is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated polymorphically. At runtime, the exact class of an object is determined, and the appropriate method is called based on the object's class. This is achieved through the use of virtual functions in C++. Run-time polymorphism is a key feature of object-oriented programming, as it allows for greater flexibility and extensibility in software design.",,,2025-06-01 00:42:40.191443
